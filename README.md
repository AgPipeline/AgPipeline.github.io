# Agriculture Processing Pipeline Documentation
This documentation covers technical information on setting up, configuring, and running the pipeline.
This includes information on creating new transformers that are not templates.

Each template transformer has a `HOW_TO.md` document that provides details on how to use the that template.
Links to technical and HOW TO documentation are provided in the section below.
Note that not all transformers will have HOW TO documentation, only the template ones.

If you are finding problems with the documentation, or have requests or ideas on how to improve the documentation, please create an [issue](https://github.com/AgPipeline/computing-pipeline/issues/new/choose) so that we can work on it.

**Transformers**
Before reading about specific transformers, it is helpful to be familiar with the [conceptual basis](https://agpipeline.github.io/transformers/transformers) for these transformers.
